# Visualize Universal Dependencies

This is a script based on the application for visualizing syntactic relations within sentences
using [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) annotation, written for the needs of a project at the 
[Institute of Slavic Studies of University of Innsbruck](https://www.uibk.ac.at/slawistik/institut/).


The script illustrates syntactic relations between sentence elements in a hierarchical tree-like plot and allows exporting in SVG format. Open via localhost or upload to your server, using "dioptra_cs.txt" file to test it.
